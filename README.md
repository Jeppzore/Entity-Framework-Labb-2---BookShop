# Database-first application with relational database. A collab project by Robin Bj√∂rkil & Jesper Stranne

To run the application, simply follow the steps below:

1. Download and restore attached .BAK-file "Bookshop.BAK" in SQLServer.

2. Build the repository project in Visual Studio and go to "Manage user Secrets" to create a secrets.json class that contains the following key: ["ConnectionString"] - which points to your chosen server in SQLServer. Here's a template for how your secrets.json file should look like:

{
  "ConnectionString": "Server=Your_Server_Name;Initial Catalog=Your_Data_Base;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}

Change "Your_Server_Name" with your chosen SQLServer.
Change "Your_Data_Base" with the name of the database you want to connect to.

3. Run the project in Visual Studio.
